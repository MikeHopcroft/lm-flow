  * Model temperature parameter
  * Should Azure OpenAI endpoint be in AzureModelDefinition, instead of environment?
  * links/ensembles
    * All node types should have names.
    * Consider moving `input` from TestCase to TestCaseType.
      * Maybe needed for training.
      * Does this put too big a burden on TestCase authors?
      * Can sometimes infer `input` if previous stage had an `expected`.
    * Verify unique names.
    * Rename Link to Stage (or Node or something else)
    * Rename ModelDefinition to ModelSpec
    * Should AzureModelDefinition include Azure endpoint? (vs environment variable)

    * Extensible way to register function model implementations
    * . Azure models
    * Commander usage should have executable name, not lm-flow.
    * Command line in runlog should be array. Joining with spaces loses information (e.g. "C:\program files\...")
    * Use name field for root folder name?
      * Would need to verify os filename name safety
      * Alphanumeric, dot, dash, now .yaml or .json extensions
    * Catch exceptions at top of eval process for test case.
    * Training
      * Add createExpectedCompletion() to Link/Stage
